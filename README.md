</p>
<p>
After the ticket is created, it will be assigned to the selected department or agent.
Agents can view and respond to the tickets assigned to them from the "Tickets" tab.
To view the details of a ticket, click on its subject from the ticket list.
Review the information provided by the requester and communicate with them by entering a response in the "Thread Entry" box.
You can also add internal notes or attachments to the ticket using the respective options.
If additional information or clarification is needed from the requester, you can request it through the ticket thread.
Agents can collaborate on tickets by assigning them to other agents, adding private notes, or using @mentions to involve specific individuals in the conversation.
<br />
<h2>Step 4: Working the Issue</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once you have gathered all the necessary information and the issue is understood, proceed to work on resolving it.
Update the ticket thread to inform the requester about the progress made and any steps taken to address the issue.
If the issue requires further investigation, you can ask the requester for additional details or perform troubleshooting steps as necessary.
Continuously update the ticket thread to keep the requester informed about the progress being made.
  <br />
<h2>Step 5: Resolution and Closure</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Once the issue is resolved, update the ticket thread to provide the solution or resolution to the requester.
If applicable, provide step-by-step instructions or any additional information that may help the requester.
Change the ticket status to "Closed" or a similar status indicating that the issue has been resolved.
If the requester confirms that the issue is indeed resolved, the ticket can be closed. Otherwise, the ticket can be reopened and the process continued.
  </p>
<p>
  That's it! You have successfully gone through the osTicket workflow, from ticket intake to resolution. Remember to always communicate clearly and promptly with the requester to ensure a smooth support experience.
